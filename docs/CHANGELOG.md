- **Conditional Detailed Logging**: Debug-level logging for normal operations, info/warning for slow operations
- **Streamlined System Coordination**: Removed redundant timing calls and improved flow control

#### 🧠 **Memory Management Improvements**
- **Limited Cache Growth**: Item evaluation cache limited to 500 entries to prevent memory leaks
- **Optimized Cache Cleanup**: Less frequent cleanup (60-second intervals) to reduce CPU overhead
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in thresholds for performance issue detection

#### 📊 **Expected Performance Improvements**
- **Looting System**: 60-70% reduction in average execution time (target: <3ms)
