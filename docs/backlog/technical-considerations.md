## Potential Areas for Investigation

### ðŸ’¡ Performance Optimization Ideas

#### Long-Running Session Performance
- **Observation**: Some users report gradual performance changes over extended sessions
- **Investigation Needed**: Memory usage patterns, garbage collection impact
- **Potential Solutions**: Memory management optimization, periodic cleanup routines
- **Priority**: Monitor for patterns before implementing solutions

#### Looting System Efficiency  
- **Observation**: Ignore list management could potentially be optimized further
- **Investigation Needed**: Ignore list size impact on performance
- **Potential Solutions**: Alternative data structures, periodic cleanup
- **Priority**: Current implementation stable, optimization ideas for future

### ðŸ’¡ Robustness Enhancement Ideas

#### API Error Handling
- **Status**: Moved to GitHub Issue #38 for development tracking
- **Summary**: Enhanced error handling for RazorEnhanced API calls with retry logic and graceful degradation

#### Configuration Validation
- **Status**: Moved to GitHub Issue #39 for development tracking  
- **Summary**: Better detection/correction of user configuration errors with auto-correction features

## Issue Reporting Process

### How to Report Issues
1. **GitHub Issues**: Create new issue with appropriate labels
2. **Include Information**: Version, system specs, reproduction steps
3. **Severity Assessment**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
4. **Community Discussion**: Use GitHub Discussions for broader issues

### Issue Classification
- **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- **High**: Performance issues, functionality problems affecting core features  
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, usability improvements
- **Low**: Enhancement ideas, nice-to-have features

### Investigation Priority
1. **Critical Issues**: Immediate investigation and resolution
2. **High Issues**: Investigation within 1-2 weeks
3. **Medium Issues**: Evaluation and planning phase
4. **Low Issues**: Community input and longer-term consideration
