## Issue Reporting Process

### How to Report Issues
1. **GitHub Issues**: Create new issue with appropriate labels
2. **Include Information**: Version, system specs, reproduction steps
3. **Severity Assessment**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
4. **Community Discussion**: Use GitHub Discussions for broader issues

### Issue Classification
- **Critical**: System crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities
- **High**: Performance issues, functionality problems affecting core features  
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, usability improvements
- **Low**: Enhancement ideas, nice-to-have features

### Investigation Priority
1. **Critical Issues**: Immediate investigation and resolution
2. **High Issues**: Investigation within 1-2 weeks
3. **Medium Issues**: Evaluation and planning phase
4. **Low Issues**: Community input and longer-term consideration
