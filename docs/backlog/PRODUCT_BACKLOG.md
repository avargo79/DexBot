## üöÄ Development Process

### From Ideas to Implementation

1. **Community Discussion**: Ideas in `ideas.md` are discussed in GitHub Discussions
2. **Technical Assessment**: Core team evaluates feasibility and complexity
3. **GitHub Issues**: Approved ideas become trackable GitHub Issues
4. **PRD Development**: High-value features receive formal Product Requirements Documents
5. **Implementation**: Features with PRDs enter the development pipeline
6. **Production**: Completed features become part of the stable system

### How to Contribute

- **Feature Ideas**: Review `ideas.md` and contribute to GitHub Discussions
- **Issue Reports**: Use GitHub Issues for bugs and problems
- **Technical Input**: Review `technical-considerations.md` for investigation opportunities
- **Development**: Contribute code through PRs for approved features

### Backlog Principles

- **Ideas-Focused**: The backlog contains concepts for discussion, not committed features
- **Community-Driven**: Feature prioritization based on community input and value assessment
- **Evidence-Based**: Implementation decisions backed by technical analysis and user needs
- **Quality-First**: All features must meet DexBot's high quality and performance standards
