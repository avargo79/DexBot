# DexBot Product Backlog Management

## Overview

This directory contains the DexBot product backlog organization following industry best practices for Agile development and product management.

## Structure

```
backlog/
├── PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md        # Master backlog file (start here)
├── high-priority/            # P1 items - current development
├── medium-priority/          # P2 items - next 2-3 versions
└── future/                   # P3+ items - long-term ideas
```

## Backlog vs PRDs

**Product Backlog Items:**
- Brief, prioritized feature requests and tasks
- One-line summaries with basic details
- Living document that changes frequently
- Focus on WHAT needs to be done and WHEN

**Product Requirements Documents (PRDs):**
- Detailed specifications for features ready for development
- Comprehensive technical and functional requirements
- Stable documents used during development
- Focus on HOW features should be built

**Relationship:** Backlog items reference PRDs when detailed specifications exist.

## Priority Levels

### High Priority (P1)
- **Timeline**: Current sprint/immediate development
- **Criteria**: Critical bugs, core functionality, performance issues
- **Review**: Weekly
- **Approval**: Required before development

### Medium Priority (P2)
- **Timeline**: Next 2-3 versions
- **Criteria**: Important features, significant enhancements
- **Review**: Bi-weekly
- **Approval**: PRD required before scheduling

### Future/Ideas (P3+)
- **Timeline**: Long-term consideration
- **Criteria**: Nice-to-have features, research items, big ideas
- **Review**: Monthly
- **Approval**: Conceptual only

## Item Types

**Features (FR-XXX)**: New functionality or capabilities
**Bugs (BUG-XXX)**: Defects and issues requiring fixes
**Enhancements (ENH-XXX)**: Improvements to existing features
**Technical Debt (TECH-XXX)**: Code maintenance and optimization
**Research (RES-XXX)**: Investigation and proof-of-concept work
**Infrastructure (INF-XXX)**: System architecture and tooling
**Integration (INT-XXX)**: Third-party integrations and APIs

## Backlog Refinement Process

### 1. Item Creation
- Identify need (bug report, feature request, technical debt)
- Create brief entry with basic information
- Assign initial priority and effort estimate
- Add to appropriate priority category

### 2. Review and Prioritization
- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly sessions
- **Activities**: 
  - Review new items
  - Adjust priorities based on business value
  - Update effort estimates
  - Identify dependencies
  - Move items between priority levels

### 3. PRD Creation
- High and medium priority features require PRDs
- PRDs created when item moves from backlog to development planning
- Detailed requirements, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications
- Stored in `/docs/prds/` directory

### 4. Development Planning
- Select items from high-priority backlog for sprint planning
- Ensure all prerequisites met (PRD, dependencies, resources)
- Move items to active development

## Best Practices

### Item Writing
- **Be specific**: Clear, actionable descriptions
- **Include value**: Why is this important?
- **Size appropriately**: Break large items into smaller ones
- **Link related work**: Reference PRDs, issues, dependencies

### Priority Management
- **Business value first**: Prioritize based on user impact
- **Consider effort**: Balance value against development cost
- **Dependencies matter**: Account for prerequisite work
- **Stay flexible**: Priorities can change based on new information

### Communication
- **Regular updates**: Keep stakeholders informed of changes
- **Clear documentation**: Maintain accurate item descriptions
- **Feedback loops**: Incorporate user and team feedback
- **Transparency**: Make backlog visible to all stakeholders

## Getting Started

1. **Review the Master Backlog**: Start with `PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md`
2. **Understand Priorities**: Check current high-priority items
3. **Check PRDs**: Review detailed specifications in `/docs/prds/`
4. **Join Refinement**: Participate in bi-weekly backlog sessions
5. **Submit Items**: Add new requests through proper channels

## Tools and Integration

- **Documentation**: Markdown files in version control
- **Tracking**: Integration with development status tracking
- **Reviews**: Regular team sessions for refinement
- **Metrics**: Track completion rates and cycle times

## Contact

For questions about backlog management or to propose new items, contact the development team through established channels.
