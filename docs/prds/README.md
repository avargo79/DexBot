# Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)

## Overview

This directory contains detailed Product Requirements Documents for DexBot features. PRDs provide comprehensive specifications for features that have been approved for development or are in active planning phases.

## PRD Structure

Each PRD follows a standardized format:
1. **Feature Overview** - Name, description, user story, business value
2. **Functional Requirements** - Detailed specifications and acceptance criteria  
3. **Technical Requirements** - Architecture, performance, and integration needs
4. **Configuration Schema** - API and configuration specifications (if applicable)
5. **Implementation Plan** - Development phases and timeline
6. **Success Criteria** - Measurable outcomes and objectives
7. **Risk Assessment** - Technical risks and mitigation strategies
8. **Future Enhancements** - Potential extensions and improvements

## PRD Development Process

### 1. Initiation
- Feature identified in product backlog
- Initial business case and value assessment
- Assignment to product owner or technical lead

### 2. Requirements Gathering
- Stakeholder interviews and feedback
- User story development and validation
- Technical feasibility assessment
- Competitive analysis (if applicable)

### 3. PRD Creation
- Detailed specification writing
- Technical architecture design
- Acceptance criteria definition
- Implementation planning

### 4. Review and Approval
- Technical review by development team
- Business review by stakeholders
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Final approval for development scheduling

### 5. Maintenance
- Updates during development as needed
- Post-implementation review and lessons learned
- Archival upon feature completion
