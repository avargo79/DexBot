## Documentation Standards

### GitHub Issues vs PRDs
- **GitHub Issues**: Brief, prioritized tasks focusing on WHAT needs to be done and WHEN
- **PRDs**: Detailed specifications focusing on HOW features should be built
- **Relationship**: GitHub Issues reference PRDs when detailed specifications exist

### Priority Levels
- **P1 (High)**: Current development priorities
- **P2 (Medium)**: Next 2-3 versions  
- **P3+ (Future)**: Long-term considerations and ideas

### Item Types
- **FR-XXX**: Features (new functionality)
- **BUG-XXX**: Bug fixes and defects
- **ENH-XXX**: Enhancements to existing features
- **TECH-XXX**: Technical debt and optimization
- **RES-XXX**: Research and investigation items

## Navigation Workflows

### For New Developers
1. Start with [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/avargo79/DexBot/issues) to understand current development priorities
2. Read the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for complete workflow
3. Review [Project Overview](OVERVIEW.md) for context and architecture
4. Check [PRDs](prds/) for detailed feature specifications

### For Contributors
1. Review [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/avargo79/DexBot/issues) for current feature priorities and development status
2. Read the [GitHub Workflow Guide](GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md) for project management processes
3. Participate in GitHub Discussions for feature concepts and community input
4. Follow the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for contribution standards

### Adding New GitHub Issues
1. Review existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Use appropriate labels according to issue type and priority
3. Reference related PRDs when detailed specifications exist
4. Follow established templates for consistency

### Creating PRDs
1. Feature identified and approved through GitHub Issues
2. Create PRD using template in [prds/README.md](prds/README.md)
3. Update related issues and documentation
4. Include acceptance criteria and technical specifications

## Best Practices

- Keep GitHub Issues current and properly labeled
- Reference PRDs in GitHub Issues for detailed specifications
- Update documentation when implementing features
- Follow established development workflow and coding standards
- Use the automated feature preparation scripts for new development

### Development Lifecycle
1. **GitHub Issue** - Feature identified and prioritized
2. **PRD Creation** - Detailed specification developed (for complex features)
3. **Implementation** - Code development following PRD requirements
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing using established patterns
5. **Documentation** - Update guides and references
6. **Release** - Version increment and deployment

### Getting Help
