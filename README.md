## Configuration

The bot uses JSON configuration files for all settings:

### Main Configuration (`config/main_config.json`)
```json
{
    "gump_position": {"x": 100, "y": 100},
    "update_interval": 1000,
    "debug_mode": false,
    "auto_save_config": true
}
```

### Auto Heal Configuration (`config/auto_heal_config.json`)
```json
{
    "bandage_threshold": 80,
    "potion_threshold": 50,
    "cure_immediately": true,
    "bandage_enabled": true,
    "potion_enabled": true
}
```

**Configuration Tips:**
- **Health Thresholds**: Set bandage_threshold higher than potion_threshold
- **Safety First**: Start with conservative settings and adjust gradually
- **Backup Configs**: The bot automatically backs up your configurations

## Item Requirements

For full functionality, ensure you have these items:

### Auto Heal System
- **Bandages**: For primary healing (recommended: 50+ bandages)
- **Heal Potions**: Greater Heal, Heal, or Lesser Heal potions
- **Cure Potions**: For automatic poison curing

### Combat System
- **Weapons**: Any valid weapon for your character type
- **Reagents**: If using magic combat (spell components)

**Inventory Tips:**
- Keep healing items easily accessible (main pack)
- Ensure adequate supplies before extended bot usage
- Consider carrying backup supplies for longer sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Bot doesn't start or crashes immediately
- **Solution**: Check that all config files are valid JSON
- **Verify**: RazorEnhanced is connected to UO server
- **Check**: No conflicting scripts are running

**Issue**: Healing not working
- **Solution**: Verify you have bandages/potions in inventory

## Development Tasks

This project uses modern Python development tools. **Note**: These tools are for development only and should NOT be run inside RazorEnhanced.

### 🛠️ Local Build Scripts

**Cross-Platform Build Commands:**

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Full build pipeline
.\scripts\build.ps1

# Quick development build
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Quick
```

**Linux/Unix/macOS (Bash):**
```bash
# Full build pipeline  
./scripts/build.sh

# Quick development build
./scripts/build.sh --quick
```

### 📦 Python Invoke Tasks

**Primary Development Commands:**
* **`invoke build`**: Complete build pipeline (test + lint + bundle + docs).
* **`invoke bundle`**: Creates the single-file `dist/DexBot.py` for RazorEnhanced.
* **`invoke test`**: Runs the test suite with coverage reporting.
* **`invoke lint`**: Code quality checks (flake8 + formatting validation).
* **`invoke docs`**: Updates API documentation from RazorEnhanced sources.
   - Fetches latest API information from RazorEnhanced documentation
   - Creates both Markdown and JSON output formats
   - Should be run manually when you need updated API reference
* **`invoke dev`**: Development mode (test + lint + bundle for quick iteration).

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Run individual tasks
python -m invoke bundle
python -m invoke test
python -m invoke lint

# Run full build pipeline
python -m invoke build

# Quick development build
python -m invoke dev

# Get help
python -m invoke help
```

**Important Notes:**
- **End users don't need these tools** - the `dist/DexBot.py` file runs directly in RazorEnhanced
- **Development tasks only work outside RazorEnhanced** - use a regular Python environment
- **Always run `invoke bundle` after making changes** to update the distributable version
