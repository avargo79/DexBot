## Configuration

### ✅ JSON Configuration Files (New!)
DexBot now uses a modern configuration system with separate JSON files:

**Main Configuration (`config/main_config.json`):**
- System toggles for the healing system
- Global settings (debug mode, timing, safety features)
- GUMP interface settings (size, position, update intervals)
- Logging preferences

**Auto Heal Configuration (`config/auto_heal_config.json`):**
- Healing method toggles (bandages, potions)
- Health thresholds and timing settings
- Item IDs and resource management
- Color coding thresholds for UI
- Journal message monitoring

### Runtime Configuration (Recommended)
Use the GUMP interface for real-time configuration changes:
- **Auto Heal Toggle**: Enable/disable entire healing system
- **Bandage Healing**: Independent toggle for bandage-based healing
- **Potion Healing**: Independent toggle for heal potion usage
- **Debug Mode**: Toggle detailed logging output
- **All settings automatically save** to JSON config files

### Advanced Configuration (Manual Editing)
You can manually edit the JSON files in the `config/` directory:

**Key Settings in `main_config.json`:**
```json
{
  "system_toggles": {
    "healing_system_enabled": true,
    "debug_mode": false
  },
  "global_settings": {
    "main_loop_delay_ms": 250,
    "target_wait_timeout_ms": 1000
  },
  "gump_interface": {
    "main_gump": {
      "width": 320,
      "height": 240,
      "x_position": 100,
      "y_position": 100
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Settings in `auto_heal_config.json`:**
```json
{
  "health_thresholds": {
    "healing_threshold_percentage": 95,
    "critical_health_threshold": 50,
    "bandage_threshold_hp": 1
  },
  "timing_settings": {
    "healing_timer_duration_ms": 11000,
    "potion_cooldown_ms": 10000
  },
  "resource_management": {
    "bandage_retry_attempts": 3,
    "low_bandage_warning": 10
  }
}
```

## Item Requirements

Ensure these items are in your backpack for the Auto Heal system:
- **Bandages** (Item ID: 0x0E21) - For normal healing
- **Heal Potions** (Item ID: 0x0F0C) - For critical health situations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No bandages found"** - Ensure bandages are in your main backpack
2. **"No heal resources"** - Check that healing methods aren't disabled in settings
3. **GUMP not updating** - Try closing and reopening the interface
4. **Script stops unexpectedly** - Check console for error messages

### Typing/Import Issues
If you encounter errors about missing `typing` module or type annotations:

```bash
# Install typing extensions for older Python versions
pip install typing-extensions

# For Python 3.7 users specifically:
pip install dataclasses typing-extensions
```

**Note:** These issues only affect development tasks outside RazorEnhanced. The bundled `dist/DexBot.py` runs without any dependencies.

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode via the GUMP interface for detailed logging:
- Shows health monitoring details
- Displays resource checking information
- Logs GUMP state changes
- Provides healing decision explanations

*   **`invoke lint`**: Runs syntax checks and code quality validation.
*   **`invoke test`**: Executes the test suite to ensure all components are working correctly.
*   **`invoke bundle`**: Packages the entire `src` directory into a single distributable file, `dist/DexBot.py`, for easy deployment.
*   **`invoke build`**: Full build pipeline (clean + lint + test + bundle).
*   **`invoke docs`**: Updates the RazorEnhanced API documentation by crawling official docs and generating a comprehensive reference guide with examples.

**API Documentation Tool:**
```bash
# Update API documentation (standalone tool)
python scripts/update_api_docs.py

# Or use the invoke task
invoke docs
```

The API documentation tool:
- Crawls the official RazorEnhanced API documentation
- Extracts modules, methods, properties, and parameters
- Generates comprehensive developer guide with practical examples
- Creates both Markdown and JSON output formats
- Should be run manually when you need updated API reference
*   **`invoke dev`**: Development mode (test + lint + bundle for quick iteration).

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Run individual tasks
python -m invoke bundle
python -m invoke test
python -m invoke lint

# Run full build pipeline
python -m invoke build

# Quick development build
python -m invoke dev

# Get help
python -m invoke help
```

**Important Notes:**
- **End users don't need these tools** - the `dist/DexBot.py` file runs directly in RazorEnhanced
- **Development tasks only work outside RazorEnhanced** - use a regular Python environment
- **Always run `invoke bundle` after making changes** to update the distributable version
